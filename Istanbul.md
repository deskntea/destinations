The city was founded as Byzantium (Byzantion) in the 7th century BC by 
Greek settlers from Megara.[9] In 330 CE, the Roman emperor Constantine 
the Great made it his imperial capital, renaming it first as New Rome 
(Nova Roma)[10] and then as Constantinople (Constantinopolis) after 
himself.[10][11] The city grew in size and influence, eventually becoming 
a beacon of the Silk Road and one of the most important cities in history.
